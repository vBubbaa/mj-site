# JustDnD

JustDnD is a site built on Django-Rest-Framework and NuxtJS that leverages full authentication letting users create Dungeons and Dragons character sheets as well as create character sheet templates with pre-filled in fields. There is a template section allowing users to browse pre-existing templates and create a character based off of a template instead of creating one from scratch.

The site was created so that when somebody wanted their Dungeons and Dragons group to use a customized character sheet the group leader could create a template and share it with their group allowing all players to have the same unified character sheet that the group leader set up. It is very easy to lose character sheets locally on your computer, so JustDnD lets users save up to 10 character sheets through the website and access it and change it on the fly.

Verified users are allowed to create infinite character sheets and create infinite templates.
